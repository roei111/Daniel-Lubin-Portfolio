          Hi! Thanks for finding me. 

My name is Daniel Lubin and I write music. In my work, I am interested in the challenge of stimulating a meaningful emotional response to the language of contemporary music.

Formerly an electronic musician yet classically trained, My creative input draws upon a wide range of genres - from EDM and Jazz to todayâ€™s modern composition world. My goal is to create an exciting fusion of those influences in the concert hall.

Under the mentorship of John Corigliano, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Music in Composition from The Juilliard School.
